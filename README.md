# A study of AirBnB in Amsterdam

A recommendation system for AirBnb customers in Amsterdam is created in this project. The user will be given information, using visulaizations, about the best Airbnb accommodations based on their preferences to make a well-informed decision when booking.


## Overview
Airbnb is a platform for travelers to book accommodations hosted by local property owners. We aim to simplify the Airbnb booking process by considering factors like location, affordability, property type, and commute details to help customers make informed decisions.





## Steps Taken  

- *Data Collection*: Airbnb dataset from Kaggle ([Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erikbruin/airbnb-amsterdam))
- *Data cleaning & wrangling*: Dropped unnecessary columns, null handling by extrapolation, used pandas for these tasks.
- *Tableau Design*: Joined the datasets in tableau and created 5 dashboards for insights.
      
## Visualizations

- Dashboard 1: *Overall Price Trend* 

This dashboard assists users in finding their ideal neighborhood and property type based on price range and average price trends, featuring revenue trends, scatter plots, tables, and bar graphs with a neighborhood filter for refined choices.
